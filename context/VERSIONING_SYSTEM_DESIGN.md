# Context Versioning System Design

## Overview
This document describes the design for implementing a versioning system for the Context Engineering system. The versioning system will help track changes to the context over time and ensure that team members are working with the correct version of the context.

## Versioning Scheme
We will use semantic versioning (SemVer) for the context versioning system:
- MAJOR version when there are incompatible changes to the context structure
- MINOR version when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- PATCH version when making backward-compatible bug fixes

Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 2.1.0)

## Version Tracking
- Each version will be tracked in a version history file
- The version history will include:
  - Version number
  - Release date
  - Description of changes
  - Author of changes
  - Impact assessment

## Implementation
1. Create a context version file (`context-version.json`) to store the current version
2. Create a version history file (`context-version-history.json`) to track all versions
3. Modify the context generation script to:
   - Check for significant changes in the context
   - Automatically bump the version when needed
   - Update the version files
4. Add version information to the generated `context.json` and `context-summary.md` files

## Version Bumping Rules
- PATCH: Minor updates to existing context information
- MINOR: Addition of new context information that doesn't break existing structure
- MAJOR: Changes that break the existing context structure or make incompatible changes

## Integration with Existing System
- The versioning system will be integrated with the existing `context-state.json` file
- The version information will be included in the generated context files
- The version history will be available for reference by team members

## Automation
- The context generation script will automatically check for changes and bump the version accordingly
- Significant changes will require manual review before version bumping
- The system will generate a change log for each version update
