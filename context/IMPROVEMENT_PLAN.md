# Context Engineering Improvement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for improving the Context Engineering system for the Mangpong Trading PWA project. The improvements will focus on making the context more structured, traceable, and useful for developers working on the project.

## Goals
1. Implement a proper versioning system for context
2. Create context mapping between different parts of the system
3. Establish dependency tracking between components
4. Enhance integration with source code
5. Improve log and error integration
6. Design a notification system for important context changes

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Context Versioning System
- Create a formal versioning scheme for context (semantic versioning)
- Add version history tracking
- Implement automatic version bumping when context changes significantly

### 2. Context Mapping System
- Design a system to show relationships between different context elements
- Create visual diagrams showing these relationships
- Implement automated mapping based on references in documentation

### 3. Dependency Tracking System
- Identify and document dependencies between different parts of the system
- Create a dependency graph
- Implement automated dependency checking

### 4. Source Code Integration
- Enhance the context generation script to extract information from source code
- Create tags or annotations in code that can be linked to context
- Implement cross-referencing between context documentation and source code

### 5. Log and Error Integration
- Enhance the integration of chat logs, error logs, and recurring errors into context
- Create a system to link resolved issues to context documentation
- Implement automatic context updates based on significant errors or changes

### 6. Notification System
- Design a notification system for important context changes
- Implement alerts for version updates
- Create a system to notify team members of significant context changes

## Timeline
- Week 1: Implement context versioning system
- Week 2: Design and implement context mapping system
- Week 3: Establish dependency tracking system
- Week 4: Enhance source code integration
- Week 5: Improve log and error integration
- Week 6: Design and implement notification system

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in time needed for new developers to understand the system
- Decrease in errors related to misunderstanding context
- Improved team communication and collaboration
- Faster feature development and bug resolution
