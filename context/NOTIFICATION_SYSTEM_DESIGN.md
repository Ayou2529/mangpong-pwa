# Notification System Design

## Overview
This document describes the design for implementing a notification system for the Context Engineering system. The notification system will alert team members to important changes in context, helping to keep everyone informed and aligned.

## Goals
1. Notify team members of important context changes
2. Alert on version updates
3. Notify of significant errors or issues
4. Keep team members informed of project status
5. Reduce the need for manual communication

## Implementation

### 1. Notification Types
- **Context Updates**: Notifications when context is significantly updated
- **Version Changes**: Notifications when context version is bumped
- **Error Alerts**: Notifications for critical or recurring errors
- **Feature Updates**: Notifications when new features are planned or implemented
- **Team Coordination**: Notifications for team meetings or coordination needs

### 2. Notification Channels
- **In-App Notifications**: Notifications within the development environment
- **Email Notifications**: Email alerts for important updates
- **Chat Integration**: Integration with team chat systems (e.g., Slack, Discord)
- **Dashboard Alerts**: Visual alerts on project dashboards

### 3. Notification Triggers
- **Automated Triggers**:
  - Context version bump
  - Detection of critical errors
  - Recurring error patterns
  - Significant changes in chat logs
- **Manual Triggers**:
  - Team member initiated notifications
  - Release announcements
  - Meeting reminders

### 4. Notification Content
- **Title**: Brief description of the notification
- **Description**: Detailed information about the notification
- **Context Links**: Links to relevant context documentation
- **Actions**: Suggested actions or links to take
- **Priority**: Importance level (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Recipients**: Who should receive the notification

## Configuration
- Create a notification configuration file (`notification-config.json`)
- Define notification rules and preferences
- Specify recipients for different types of notifications
- Set up notification channels and their configurations

## Integration with Existing System
1. Extend `generate-context.js` to trigger notifications when appropriate
2. Integrate with error logging to trigger error alerts
3. Connect to chat log analysis to trigger relevant notifications
4. Link notifications to context documentation

## Notification Examples

### Context Update Notification
```
Title: Context Updated - Version 2.1.0 Released
Description: The context has been updated with new information about the commission calculation feature.
Context Links: 
- /context/business/domain.md#commission-system
- /context/technical/architecture.md#data-flow
Actions:
- Review the updated context
- Update your local context files
Priority: Medium
```

### Error Alert Notification
```
Title: Critical Error Detected - Network Error (ERR001)
Description: A critical network error has been detected that affects data fetching from the backend.
Context Links:
- /context/technical/architecture.md#backend-architecture
- /context/business/processes.md#job-tracking
Actions:
- Investigate the network connectivity issue
- Check the Google Apps Script URL in config.js
Priority: High
```

### Feature Update Notification
```
Title: New Feature Planned - Date Filtering for History Page
Description: A new feature has been planned to add date filtering to the history page based on recent chat discussions.
Context Links:
- /context/business/roles.md#messenger
- /context/technical/architecture.md#frontend-components
Actions:
- Review the feature requirements
- Plan implementation
Priority: Medium
```
