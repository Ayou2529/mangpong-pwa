# Context Mapping System Design

## Overview
This document describes the design for implementing a context mapping system. The context mapping system will visually and textually show relationships between different parts of the context, helping team members understand how different elements of the system relate to each other.

## Mapping Structure
The context mapping will show relationships between:
1. Business Context Elements
   - Business Domain
   - Business Rules
   - Roles
   - Processes
   
2. Technical Context Elements
   - Architecture Components
   - Data Models
   - APIs
   - Libraries
   
3. Operational Context Elements
   - Workflows
   - Policies
   - Procedures
   
4. User Context Elements
   - Personas
   - User Journeys
   - Use Cases

## Relationship Types
1. **Dependency**: One element depends on another
2. **Influence**: One element influences another
3. **Containment**: One element contains another
4. **Reference**: One element references another

## Implementation
1. Create a context mapping file (`context-mapping.json`) to store relationships
2. Create a visual representation of the mapping (`context-mapping.png` or `context-mapping.svg`)
3. Add mapping information to the generated context files
4. Implement automated mapping based on references in documentation

## Mapping File Structure
The `context-mapping.json` file will contain:
- Nodes: Representing context elements
- Edges: Representing relationships between elements
- Metadata: Additional information about relationships

## Automation
1. The system will automatically detect references between context elements
2. Relationships will be categorized based on keywords in the documentation
3. Manual review will be required for complex relationships
4. The visual mapping will be automatically generated from the mapping data

## Integration with Existing System
1. The mapping system will integrate with the existing context files
2. Mapping information will be included in the generated `context.json` file
3. A summary of key relationships will be added to `context-summary.md`

## Visualization
1. Create a simple diagram showing major context elements and their relationships
2. Use different colors or shapes to represent different types of context elements
3. Use different line styles to represent different types of relationships
4. Provide both high-level and detailed views of the mapping

## Maintenance
1. The mapping will be updated when context elements are added, removed, or changed
2. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure accuracy
3. Team members will be encouraged to suggest improvements to the mapping
