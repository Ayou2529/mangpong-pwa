# Dependency Tracking System Design

## Overview
This document describes the design for implementing a dependency tracking system. The dependency tracking system will help identify and document dependencies between different parts of the system, making it easier to understand the impact of changes and plan development work.

## Dependency Types
1. **Component Dependencies**: Dependencies between different software components
2. **Feature Dependencies**: Dependencies between different features
3. **Data Dependencies**: Dependencies between different data elements
4. **Process Dependencies**: Dependencies between different business processes
5. **Team Dependencies**: Dependencies between different team members or teams

## Implementation
1. Create a dependency tracking file (`dependencies.json`) to store dependency information
2. Add dependency information to the generated context files
3. Implement automated dependency detection based on code analysis and documentation
4. Create a visual representation of dependencies

## Dependency File Structure
The `dependencies.json` file will contain:
- Dependencies: Listing all dependencies with their details
- Dependency Types: Categorizing different types of dependencies
- Impact Analysis: Information about the impact of changes to each dependency

## Automation
1. The system will automatically detect dependencies based on:
   - Import statements in code
   - References in documentation
   - API usage patterns
   - Data flow analysis
2. Dependencies will be categorized based on their type and impact
3. Manual review will be required for complex dependencies
4. The system will generate alerts for circular dependencies or overly complex dependency chains

## Integration with Existing System
1. The dependency tracking system will integrate with the existing context files
2. Dependency information will be included in the generated `context.json` file
3. A summary of key dependencies will be added to `context-summary.md`

## Visualization
1. Create a dependency graph showing components and their relationships
2. Use different colors or line styles to represent different types of dependencies
3. Provide both high-level and detailed views of the dependency graph
4. Highlight critical dependencies that could impact multiple parts of the system

## Impact Analysis
1. When a component or feature is modified, the system will analyze its dependencies
2. The system will generate a report showing potentially affected components
3. Team members will be alerted about significant impacts
4. The impact analysis will be stored for future reference

## Maintenance
1. Dependencies will be updated when code or documentation changes
2. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure accuracy
3. Team members will be encouraged to update dependency information when they identify new dependencies
4. The system will periodically scan for new dependencies automatically

## Tools and Techniques
1. Static code analysis to identify component dependencies
2. Documentation analysis to identify feature and process dependencies
3. Data flow analysis to identify data dependencies
4. Team input to identify team dependencies

## Benefits
1. Easier impact analysis for proposed changes
2. Better planning for development work
3. Identification of potential bottlenecks
4. Improved onboarding for new team members
5. Reduced risk of breaking changes
