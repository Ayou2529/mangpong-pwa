# Source Code Integration Enhancement Design

## Overview
This document describes the design for enhancing the integration of source code with the Context Engineering system. This enhancement will help create stronger links between documentation and implementation, making it easier to understand and maintain the system.

## Goals
1. Create traceability between context documentation and source code
2. Automatically extract relevant information from source code
3. Enable cross-referencing between documentation and implementation
4. Improve code documentation by linking to context

## Implementation

### 1. Code Annotations
- Introduce a standardized annotation system in the codebase
- Annotations will link code elements to context documentation
- Supported annotation types:
  - `@context`: Links to specific context documentation
  - `@feature`: Links to feature descriptions
  - `@role`: Links to role definitions
  - `@process`: Links to business processes

### 2. Enhanced Context Generation
- Modify `generate-context.js` to parse code annotations
- Extract information from source code to enrich context
- Create bidirectional links between code and context

### 3. Code Analysis
- Implement static analysis to identify:
  - Component relationships
  - Data flow patterns
  - API usage
  - Feature implementations

### 4. Documentation Generation
- Generate code documentation that references context
- Create API documentation linked to context
- Generate component diagrams based on code structure

## Annotation Examples

### JavaScript/HTML/CSS Annotations
```javascript
// @context business/domain.md#commission-system
// @feature payroll-calculation
function calculateCommission(jobData) {
  // Implementation
}
```

```html
<!-- @context technical/architecture.md#frontend-components -->
<!-- @feature job-history -->
<div id="history-container">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

### Context-Code Mapping
- Create a mapping file that links context elements to code locations
- Update this mapping during context generation
- Use the mapping to generate cross-references

## Integration with Existing System
1. Extend `generate-context.js` to parse code annotations
2. Add code-derived information to `context.json`
3. Include code references in `context-summary.md`
4. Generate a code-context cross-reference document

## Benefits
1. Improved traceability between requirements and implementation
2. Easier impact analysis when making changes
3. Better onboarding for new developers
4. More accurate documentation
5. Automated detection of outdated documentation

## Automation
1. Automatically detect and parse code annotations
2. Generate context-code mapping
3. Identify missing annotations
4. Alert on inconsistencies between code and context

## Maintenance
1. Encourage team members to add annotations when writing code
2. Periodically review and update annotations
3. Integrate annotation validation into CI/CD pipeline
4. Provide tooling to make annotation creation easier
