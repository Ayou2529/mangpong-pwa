# Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation roadmap for the Context Engineering improvements. It details the steps, timeline, and resources needed to implement the enhancements designed in the previous documents.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Week 1: Context Versioning System
- [x] Create versioning system design document
- [x] Implement context version files (`context-version.json`, `context-version-history.json`)
- [ ] Modify `generate-context.js` to support versioning
- [ ] Add version information to generated context files
- [ ] Test versioning system with sample updates

### Week 2: Context Mapping System
- [x] Create mapping system design document
- [x] Implement context mapping file (`context-mapping.json`)
- [ ] Create visual representation of context mapping
- [ ] Modify `generate-context.js` to include mapping information
- [ ] Test mapping system with sample context elements

## Phase 2: Relationships and Integration (Week 3-4)

### Week 3: Dependency Tracking System
- [x] Create dependency tracking design document
- [x] Implement dependency tracking file (`dependencies.json`)
- [ ] Enhance `generate-context.js` to parse and include dependencies
- [ ] Create visual representation of dependencies
- [ ] Test dependency tracking with sample components

### Week 4: Source Code Integration
- [x] Create source code integration design document
- [x] Implement code-context mapping file (`code-context-mapping.json`)
- [ ] Modify `generate-context.js` to parse code annotations
- [ ] Implement static analysis for component relationships
- [ ] Test code integration with sample annotations

## Phase 3: Intelligence and Automation (Week 5-6)

### Week 5: Log and Error Integration
- [x] Create log and error integration design document
- [x] Implement error-context mapping file (`error-context-mapping.json`)
- [ ] Enhance error logging to include context references
- [ ] Implement chat log analysis
- [ ] Test error-context linking with sample errors

### Week 6: Notification System
- [x] Create notification system design document
- [x] Implement notification configuration file (`notification-config.json`)
- [ ] Implement notification triggering mechanisms
- [ ] Set up notification channels (email, chat, in-app)
- [ ] Test notification system with sample triggers

## Phase 4: Refinement and Documentation (Week 7-8)

### Week 7: System Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate all components into a cohesive system
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of the entire context engineering system
- [ ] Refine and optimize based on testing results
- [ ] Address any issues or gaps identified during testing

### Week 8: Documentation and Training
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for the new context engineering system
- [ ] Develop training materials for team members
- [ ] Conduct training sessions for the development team
- [ ] Gather feedback and make final adjustments

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in time needed for new developers to understand the system (target: 50% reduction)
- Decrease in errors related to misunderstanding context (target: 70% reduction)
- Improved team communication and collaboration (measured through surveys)
- Faster feature development and bug resolution (target: 30% improvement)

## Resources Needed
- Development time from the engineering team
- Access to project documentation and codebase
- Tools for visualization and diagramming
- Access to communication channels (email, chat systems)
- Time for team training and onboarding

## Risks and Mitigation
- Adoption resistance: Address through training and clear communication of benefits
- Complexity overload: Implement gradually and gather feedback
- Maintenance overhead: Design for automation and ease of updates
- Tool compatibility: Ensure tools work in the team's existing environment
